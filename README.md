Yet another codesigning app, have you ever wondered what if Feather and Esign had a child?

## Why?
Since Esign is end of service so people been moving to other signing apps, but Esign was a really big part of the community, so with the help of Feather as the base app, I tried to recreate Esign as close as possible so you guys can easier to get familiar and less app switching for smooth sideloading.

Another reason is this app was built specifically for Khoindvn to share his certificates, allowing more people to access to sideloading without even have to buy a certificate!
